# Wish List App
## Project Description

The project aimed to create an application for managing a wish list, consisting of three main screens:

### 1. List Screen:

On this screen, users can browse a list of items representing their wishes. Each list item includes at least two text pieces of information and one piece of information presented as another graphic component (e.g., an image). The list is sorted differently than the order of adding items, either alphabetically or in ascending/descending order for numerical values. Additionally, the screen features a summary for the presented items (total quantity).

**Additional features:**
- Selecting a list item enables preview and editing.
- Long-pressing triggers an alert prompting to delete the item. Upon confirmation, the entry disappears, and the summary updates.
- Button for adding a new item.

### 2. Preview Entry Screen:

Activated by clicking on an existing entry on the list, this screen allows users to read all data about the selected list item. It includes a button for editing the entry's data.

### 3. Add/Edit Entry Screen:

Activated by clicking the add button or when editing an existing entry, this screen allows for assigning/changing data and includes a button to save the changes/entered data. Saving data is not within the task's scope, and changes may reset upon closing the application.
